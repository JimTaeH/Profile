<h1> Image Captioning with CLIP Prefix Caption Model on Traffy Fondue Datasets </h1>
In this project, the purpose is to generate the captions from images. And use that caption to do some things such as search for images from similar captions or classify the image from its caption. With this hypothesis, our idea is to help Traffy Fondue staff easier to deal with incoming images from users e.g. verifying problems using a caption of an image matching the request from user. With this model, it enables the computer to transcribe image context into text description and use it to process or do something more varied.
